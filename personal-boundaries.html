            When designing <em>Personal Boundaries</em>, I imagined my zine to
            be a friend to the reader, providing them with confidence to set
            their boundaries. For a reader in the year 2022, I think this word
            is about nurturing respect towards ourselves. This entails
            recognizing our values and how we want to be treated, and actively
            listening to our body’s needs. With the changes in our lifestyle
            that were brought about by the pandemic, I think it is especially
            crucial to reflect on whether or not our personal boundaries are
            acknowledged and what we can do to protect them.

          <!-- <p class="slide-up show-on-scroll">
            Over the last year, I’ve become aware that I let my personal
            boundaries be overstepped by myself and people around me. These
            situations usually unfold themselves in small, everyday situations.
            I have made it my goal to act when I find myself in a situation
            where I feel my boundaries are being neglected. I worked on being
            more assertive and listening to my body, thus developing healthier
            relationships with myself and others. I would like this book to
            reach the hands of those who need support in finding the voice to
            speak up in undesirable situations, or those like myself who need to
            be reminded that our boundaries are to be loved and cherished.

            The zine is polyvocal, gathering the voices and stories from many
            sources. The first spread features the definition of “personal
            boundaries” from Wikipedia, a democratic platform. The second spread
            shows my thoughts on setting boundaries, along with tips on being
            assertive from Chantalle Blikman. The third spread presents a poem
            by July Westhale called “On the Beauty of Setting Boundaries.” I
            fell in love with this poem upon doing my research on boundaries.
            And finally, the back page of the zine is a poster that I designed
            that encapsulates the theme of the zine.

            There are 8 pages in total (including the cover and back pages). The
            page size is 2.75 x 4.25 inches. The printed zine can unfold into
            one large piece of paper. When flipped, the verso is 11 x 8.5
            inches.
