          <em>Ring-a-ring-ding-ding!</em> Shelee the snail got a special phone
          call from her friend Coco. What's this all about, a game of
          hide-and-seek? Shelee's got to get out of her comfort zone and explore
          the wilderness.

        <p class="slide-up show-on-scroll">
          I designed this <b>narrative Bitsy game</b> that centers around the
          positive message of friendship. The player’s main goal is to help
          Shelee uncover her friends' hiding spots. Interacting with colored
          characters and objects is key in progressing the narrative.
        </p>

        <p class="slide-up show-on-scroll">
          Inspired by my walks in nature, I developed characters and settings
          based on animals and plants I encountered. I paid special attention to
          how various spaces can be used in conjunction with the narrative to
          communicate progress. I included hubspaces (where a room is dedicated
          to two divergent paths and communicates possible actions), prospect
          spaces (rock garden that spans two rooms to give the impression of
          being a gargantuan space), a maze (stimulates player’s thinking), and
          narrow spaces (small bridge that creates contrast and builds up
          anticipation for what comes next).
